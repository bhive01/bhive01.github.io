The intention of this set of pages is to keep up with #52papers by posting a review of a papers that I read, but also interesting things I find in the R space and perhaps even some life musings. Thanks to @tpoi for the encouragement and I hope that I can keep it up (mainly because he'll be doing #365papers and it makes me look lazy enough).
