In early 2018 I started homebrewing on the side with a friend of my son's dad. It's something I had long been wanting to try, but it seemed difficult from the outside. I would like to tell you that is not actually the case, but after more than a year of doing it I can say that it is one of the deepest rabbit holes I have ever gone down.

It is also one of the most fun and exciting ones I've ever been down. After a year we've only ever dumped one batch and that was because of a very fundamental misunderstanding about what we were doing when we went from an extract kit immediately to all grain brewing without having a clue what we were doing. That's all sorted out now though and we've been making all grain beer for over a year now mostly with successes.

I definitely and a big fan of the recipes and coming up with crazy ideas and mixing tastes. I gravitate to fruit and wheat beers instinctively because they have lower IBUs (bitterness units) and because I love fruit. Our watermelon wheat beer went over very well among friends and work colleagues. I handed out 15 gallons of that brew last summer alone and will probably do something similar this year (although I've just started kegging so I don't know what that means necessarily). 
So, the purpose of this site (at least in part) is to describe my adventures in brewing including equipment, recipes, exbeeriments, and whatnot.

If you're unfamiliar with "exbeeriments" they are mini-taste experiments where you try and isolate one variable as much as possible and ask people to taste the difference with a triangle test. For more on this test and what it hopes to accomplish, see the explanation by Denny Cohn and Drew Beecham on their [Experimental Brewing website](https://www.experimentalbrew.com/experiments/about_triangle_testing)
