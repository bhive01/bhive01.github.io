I had great intentions with this site for working on R-related things, and image analysis, and reading papers, but it did not pan out. So for now I'm trying something different. I've started homebrewing and I'm interested in collecting my thoughts here on what I'm doing in that space (perhaps I can work out how to separate topics further with Jekyll so I can have spaces for those things, but for now it's probably all in one place.
